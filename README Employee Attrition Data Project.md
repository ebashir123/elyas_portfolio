# Data Analysis Project: Loan Default Risk Analysis

Welcome to my data analysis project showcasing an analysis of **employee attrition data** from companies that explores the various factors that impact rates of attrition for employees.

## Project Description
In this project, I analyzed employee attrition data to address the factors that lead to increased attrition rates. Summary tables were used for descriptive statistics. Additionally, boxplots, bar charts, and histograms were utilized to visualize the data. The purpose of this analysis is to address the factors that impact employee attrition rates in order to allow insights regarding informed decision-making for companies to reduce the risk of increased employee attrition.
