# Elyas Bashir Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio Project repository. This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects that highlight my skills, experience, and problem-solving abilities as a data analyst.

## Project Descriptions
### Project 1: COVID-19 Analaysis
In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University in order to gain insights into dispersion patterns of COVID cases and COVID deaths at the county level. I utilized Python along with pandas for data manipulation, while matplotlib and folium were utilized for data visualization. Additionally, the use of geopandas, contextily, mapclassify, aiohttp, and fsspec were implemented.
