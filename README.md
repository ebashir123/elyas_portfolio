# Elyas Bashir Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio Project repository. This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects that highlight my skills, experience, and problem-solving abilities as a data analyst.

## Project Descriptions
### Project 1: COVID-19 Analaysis
In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University in order to gain insights into dispersion patterns of COVID cases and COVID deaths at the county level. I utilized Python along with pandas for data manipulation, while matplotlib and folium were utilized for data visualization. Additionally, the use of geopandas, contextily, mapclassify, aiohttp, and fsspec were implemented.

### Project 2: Loan Default Mitigation
In this project, I analyzed bank loan data in an effort to address the factors that lead to increased default rates, so as to mitigate any further risks and provide these financial companies with better insights on how to address several factors regarding their consumers. This includes summary tables and statistical analysis on variables, as well as data visualization via bar charts, density histograms, and boxplots. Additionally, models such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and random forests were implemented to assess the data.

### Project 3: Employee Attrition Analysis
In this project, I analyzed employee attrition data to address the factors that lead to increased attrition rates. Summary tables were used for descriptive statistics. Additionally, boxplots, bar charts, and histograms were utilized to visualize the data. The purpose of this analysis is to address the factors that impact employee attrition rates in order to allow insights regarding informed decision-making for companies to reduce the risk of increased employee attrition.
