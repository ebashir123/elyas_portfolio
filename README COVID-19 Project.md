# Data Analysis Project: Interactive Choropleth Map of COVID-19 Cases at County Level

Welcome to my data analysis project showcasing an interactive choropleth map visualizing COVID-19 cases at the county level. Please note that the choropleth map and other interactive elements are not displayed on GitHub due to its static rendering. However, you can download the Jupyter Notebook file and run it locally to experience the full interactivity.

## Project Description
In this project, I created an interactive choropleth map that allows users to explore COVID-19 cases at the county level by selecting a specific state. The map dynamically updates based on user input, providing real-time insights into the severity of the pandemic across different regions.

## How to Run
To view and interact with the choropleth map, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download**: Clone this repository to your local machine or click the "Download ZIP" button to get a copy of the project files.

2. **Setup Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the required libraries specified in the project.

3. **Open the Notebook**: Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file (`COVID-19 Portfolio Project Data Visualization.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the notebook cells in sequential order. This will load the data, process it, and generate the interactive choropleth map.

5. **Explore the Map**: Once the notebook is executed, you will be prompted to enter a name and the state you want to view. You will be able to interact with the choropleth map by selecting different states to view COVID-19 cases at the county level. Hover over counties to see detailed information.

Please note that a stable internet connection may be required for certain map functionalities, as some features rely on online map tile services.
